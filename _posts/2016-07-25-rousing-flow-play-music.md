  Readers of the Independent Spotlight know that Garageband is my go-to when I
  refer to shoddy self-production, particularly in the hip-hop community. For
  all of the shots I fire at it, however, I do understand its potential. It's a
  remarkably good digital audio workstation for a beginner that has versatility
  unparalleled in comparative suites.
